# King-County-House-Sale-Prices-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
## Dataset
- This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. 
 
- It's a great dataset for evaluating simple regression models. 
 
 
 
- The dataset consists of 21 columns, amongst them we use: 
 1) sqft_living as X (Independent) variable 
 2) price as Y (Dependent) variable 
 
- This dataset has 21000+ rows or records that’s why we use only 50 iterations or epoch in the loop which you can check from code file.  Let suppose our data set has 200 rows than we have to take more iterations like 3000-4000 which were also discussed in the class. Simply it’s means if data is big then in min epoch it can learn, and in case of small data it required more epoch.
